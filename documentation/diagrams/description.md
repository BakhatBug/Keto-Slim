# Diagrams Description

This directory contains visual representations of the project's architecture, flow, and database structure.

## [ERD](file:///C:/Users/PMY/Desktop/Internship/ketoslim/documentation/diagrams/erd.png)

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) visualizes the database schema for the KetoSlim application. It details the entities such as Users, Meal Plans, Progress Tracking, and their relationships. This is crucial for understanding how data is structured and related within the backend database (MongoDB).

## [Frontend Flow](file:///C:/Users/PMY/Desktop/Internship/ketoslim/documentation/diagrams/frontend%20flow.png)

This diagram illustrates the user flow through the frontend application. It maps out the user journey from the landing page, through the authentication process (Login/Signup), to the core features like the Personalized Plan Form, Dashboard, and result displays. It helps in understanding the navigation structure and user experience.

## [Higher Architecture](file:///C:/Users/PMY/Desktop/Internship/ketoslim/documentation/diagrams/higher%20architecture.png)

The Higher Level Architecture diagram provides a broad overview of the system's components. It shows the interaction between the Frontend (React + Vite), Backend (Node.js + Express), and the Database (MongoDB). It may also include external integrations or services, giving a "big picture" view of the technical stack.

## [Integration](file:///C:/Users/PMY/Desktop/Internship/ketoslim/documentation/diagrams/intergration.png)

The Integration diagram likely details how different parts of the system integrate and communicate with each other. This could specifically focus on API endpoints, data exchange formats (JSON), and the flow of requests and responses between the client and server. It essentially bridges the gap between the frontend UI and backend logic.
